### Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

With a compelling academic foundation in Computer Science and Business Technology Management from KAIST, I am a dedicated and passionate scholar currently undertaking my 9th semester. My past internships have been focused on the data science and analytics industry, where I excelled at manipulating data and narrating meaningful stories from complex numerical narratives. 

My passion for data extends beyond mere interpretation; I aim to utilize these insights to drive strategic decisions within organizations, boosting their efficiency and effectiveness. My experience has allowed me to develop excellent leadership and teamwork skills, equipping me with the ability to thrive in both individual and collaborative environments.

In addition, I am currently engrossed in cutting-edge research on distributed systems and the efficient training of transformer models. My ultimate goal is to create and refine the technology that facilitates streamlined and accessible data processing. I am not just a student of technology, but a fervent explorer, eager to make meaningful contributions to the vast and ever-evolving tech universe. Through rigorous academic and practical pursuits, I am committed to advancing the future of data science and distributed systems.
