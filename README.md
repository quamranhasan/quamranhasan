### Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

A recent graduate from KAIST with a double major in Computer Science and Business Technology Management.

I love to rumble with data collection, and analysis and tell stories with data. From not having written a single line of code prior to university, now I live a life where I have a domestic relationship with Python. Having past experiences in several internships I have grown a liking for Marketing Research and Data Analytics.

Apart from industry experience, I have fathomed research experience in the fields of transformers and Large Language Models, especially when it comes to tasks relevant to low-resource languages.

Finally, I love to read books, especially thrillers by Dan Brown, and I love playing instruments like the bass and drums.
